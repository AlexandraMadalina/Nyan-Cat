- Make the rain stop after 10 seconds
- While it's raining Nyan Cats, the [background](https://s3.amazonaws.com/spoonflower/public/design_thumbnails/0439/6605/naynback9_shop_preview.png) should become the one from the original animation and all the other elements should disappear until it's done raining cats ;)
